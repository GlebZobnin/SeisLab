# SeisLab

**SeisLab** is a toolkit for working with various types of seismic data. It provides functionality for loading, visualizing, and analyzing seismic datasets, including support for the **SeisPro** format and basic 3D visualization features.

Basically, this repository contains some functions that I use in my work at the lab.

From time to time, I will update the README and other modules related to this project.  
By the way, Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you find any mistakes or issues in the code or modules and let me know.
